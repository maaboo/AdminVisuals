I'd like to share with you my icon set for Visio 2013 diagrams. 
The idea was to have clear and minimalistic icons ready to use with connectors. 
You can create networking, power, office, SAN, datacenter and even CCTV diagrams. 

Please, don't hesitate to leave feedback. 
I'm not a graphic designer I've just been working alonside with them. :-)
